# This repository contains the code I developed for the final project 
# for my ME/CS 132a course at Caltech. 

# This system generates a path from a start location to an end 
# location within a user-specified description of a closed, polygonal 
# room with polygonal obstacles in its interior using the Wave Front 
# Potential Method.
